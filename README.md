## INFO-664 FINAL PROJECT - Yelp Restaurants Map

#### Introduction
elp Restaurants Map is created for the Spring 2022 Programming for Cultural Heritage course at Pratt Institute. The data sources used in this project are Yelp Restaurant Data and New York Census Bureau. 

My final project is to show the distributions of retaurants in NYC city. The dataset collecting from Yelp contains restaurants information like price, ratings, and alias. I used Python Pandas to organize the data and applied html css ,and Javascript libraries to turn them into the interactive web map. I took the price and rating as the filter values. Also I added the buffer features so that we can see the distance between restaurnats and subway stations.
